+++ title = "HTML Basics" weight = 1 +++

So there you are, relaxing in a calm, sunny meadow. You gently curl back the
title page of your favorite Sabrina the Teenage Witch fanfiction novel to come
across this: ```<!DOCTYPE html>```

What's this? Someone sold you "Sabrina XVI" in the wrong language. Lucky for
you, HTML is the language you'd want to see if you're a student at Epicodus, as
it is the basic structure of our story. 

Pro Tip: After you've created an html document and opened it up with VS code, if
the first thing you type is ! followed by the enter key, a basic HTML template
will magically appear. It'll look something like this:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
  
</body>
</html>
```

Take note of the indentation, as this is something they'll be looking at
throughout your time at epicodus. And they aren't being sticklers about it: this
makes your code easier to read and is a best-of-the-best practice for coders all
across the 9142 galaxies or whatever. 

VSCode and the majority of code-specific text editors will create vertical lines
whenever you open a tag and intend for the content that's inside of it. Use
these lines to match up your [opening and
closing](https://www.semrush.com/blog/html-tags-list/) tags.

Another healthy tip, here are a list of some of the common HTML elements that
you can use to "style" your text without using CSS:
- &lt;b&gt; <b>bolds your text</b> &lt;/b&gt;  
- &lt;strong&gt; <strong>bold, but notes to another coder what's
  important</strong> &lt;/strong&gt;
- &lt;i&gt; <i>italizes your text</i> &lt;/i&gt;
- &lt;em&gt; <em>similar to italizes, but notes to another coder what's in
  emphasis</em> &lt;/em&gt;
- &lt;u&gt; <u>underlines your text </u> &lt;/u&gt;
- &lt;strike&gt; <strike>puts a strike through your text</strike>
  &lt;/strike&gt;
- There are also &lt;h1&gt; through &lt;h5&gt; tags to resize your text to be
  used like as a header.  
[There are many more in addition to these as
well](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element), but it's not
bad to keep it simple while you can.
